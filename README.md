# Snake-Game-

In this project I have used C langauge to develop a snake game to show the concept of 2-d Array with functions
And I also showed a feature that in C language we can use cmd commands in code itself. 
I have created S3 bucket on amazon AWS and generated rootkeys of S3 bucket and then linked that S3 bucket with highscore file of game
